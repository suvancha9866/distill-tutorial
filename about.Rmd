## About Me
Hello. My name is *Suvan Chatakondu* and I am from Aurora, Illinois. I am going to be a rising Senior at Metea Valley High School. I am very interested in Statistics and Data Science and I hope to major in something related to the field one day. I have a passion for watching shows and movies too.

## About the Project
*This project* is regarding a test of my Final Project.

### Goals
*My Goal is to learn about how to make a site for my final project.
*My Goal is to make a pretty good first run so that my final project will look nice.
  +However, I need to learn first.
